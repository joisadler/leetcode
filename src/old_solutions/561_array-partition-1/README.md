Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>), ..., (a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>) which makes sum of min(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,4,3,2]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
</pre>
Note:
- **n** is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
- All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
