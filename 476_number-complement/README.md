Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**
1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 5
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>
**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 1
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>
