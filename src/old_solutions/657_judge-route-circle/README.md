Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the **original place**.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L` (Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> "UD"
<b>Output:</p> true
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> "LL"
<b>Output:</b> false
</pre>
